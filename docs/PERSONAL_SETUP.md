# Use Wardrobe privately on your computer and phone

The Mac is the home for the app, photos, API key, and `data/library.json`. Tailscale gives your phone an encrypted HTTPS route back to the Mac. Nothing is deployed to a public website.

```text
iPhone  ── private Tailscale connection ──▶  Wardrobe on this Mac  ──▶  local data/
Mac browser ──────────────────────────────▶  127.0.0.1:4173
```

The Mac must be on and connected for imports or edits. The phone keeps a read-only saved copy of previously viewed pieces when the Mac is unavailable.

## 1. Set up Wardrobe on the Mac

From this repository:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Add an OpenAI API key to `.env`. Add a clear PNG reference photo of yourself at `data/model-reference.png`; it is used for modeled previews. Both `.env` and the entire `data/` directory are ignored by Git and stay on this Mac.

The selected source photos and the model reference are sent to the OpenAI API when you ask the importer to analyze, extract, or model clothing. They are not served as a public website; the local database and generated library remain in `data/`.

Start the private app:

```bash
npm run personal
```

Keep that terminal open. On the Mac, the app is available at [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173).

### Optional: start Wardrobe automatically at login

Stop the terminal process above, then run:

```bash
npm run personal:install
```

This creates the macOS login service `dev.wardrobe.personal`. Its logs are in `~/Library/Logs/Wardrobe.log` and `~/Library/Logs/Wardrobe.error.log`.

To remove the login service without touching any wardrobe data:

```bash
npm run personal:uninstall
```

Run `npm run personal:install` again after pulling or making code changes; it rebuilds the app before restarting the service.

## 2. Create the private phone connection

1. Install Tailscale on the Mac and phone, then sign in to both with the same account.
2. On the Mac, expose only the local Wardrobe port to your Tailscale network:

   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:4173
   tailscale serve status
   ```

3. `tailscale serve status` prints a private URL similar to `https://your-mac.your-tailnet.ts.net`. Open it in Safari on the phone while Tailscale is connected.

Use `tailscale serve`, never `tailscale funnel`: Serve is limited to your Tailscale network, while Funnel intentionally publishes a service to the internet. The `--bg` configuration survives Tailscale and computer restarts.

## 3. Put it on the phone’s Home Screen

In Safari, open the private `https://…ts.net` URL, tap Share, choose **Add to Home Screen**, keep **Open as Web App** enabled, and tap **Add**.

The installed app can choose photos from the camera roll or open the camera through **Add clothes**. Imports, metadata edits, and deletes all save to the same `data/library.json`, so the phone and Mac show the same collection.

## Back up the wardrobe

Back up the whole ignored `data/` directory to an encrypted personal backup. It contains the database, original import jobs, generated garment images, and the local identity reference. Do not commit it to Git.

## If something is not working

- **The phone shows “Saved copy”:** confirm the Mac is awake, the Wardrobe service is running, and Tailscale is connected on both devices.
- **The phone cannot open the URL:** run `tailscale serve status` on the Mac and use the HTTPS URL it prints.
- **Imports say setup is required:** check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` and `data/model-reference.png`, then restart the Wardrobe service.
- **Port 4173 is already in use:** stop any other `npm run personal` or `npm run dev` process before starting the login service.
